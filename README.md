## Next Short Steps

- Add fee to transactions ✅
- Add fee to sign and transactions methods ✅
- Add Binary Heap transaction pool sorted by gas(fee) ✅
- create endpoint for getting new signed transactions ✅
- add transaction pool on server, for receiving the endpoint transactions ✅
- add transaction pool on miner, and select the transactions to process in the ✅
start of the mining process, adding also the mint prize
- in the beginning, there won't be balance checking ✅
